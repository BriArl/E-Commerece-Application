As the backend developer for EasyShop, my primary goal is to work on Version 2 of the website. The current website is operational and running as Version 1. I will be making modifications to the existing Spring Boot API project, which serves as the backend server. The data storage relies on a MySQL database, and I have access to the database script detailing the current data structure.

EasyShop is an online shopping platform, and my aim is to enhance and expand its functionalities for Version 2. This involves adding new features and improving the existing codebase to provide a better user experience.
